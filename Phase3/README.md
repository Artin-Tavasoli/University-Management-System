In this phase, I've implemented a web server based on the HTTP protocol for the application that was developed in the previous phases. The browser acts as the client in this architecture.
## To simply run
  build the project using **make** then enter below command
  
  ./utms.out </path/to/majors.csv> </path/to/students.csv> </path/to/courses.csv> </path/to/teachers.csv>

  then open http://localhost:8080/ on your local browser

**AP HTTP::_server_** is a simple web application server-side blocking framework for C++.  
This library is based on simplified versions of [W++](http://konteck.github.io/wpp/), [HappyHTTP](http://scumways.com/happyhttp/happyhttp.html), and [cpp-netlib](http://cpp-netlib.org/).
